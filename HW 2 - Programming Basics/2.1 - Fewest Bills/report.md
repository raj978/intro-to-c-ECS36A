<hr>

## Game Setup
The first step of solving the Tic-tac-Toe problem is to set-up the game which incolves the following steps: 
1. Setting up a 3 x 3 grid to allow the players to place X's and O's.
2. Assigning the X piece to Player1 and O piece to Player.

## Playing the Game
Once the setup is complete, the problem of Tic-Tac-Toe can be solved by allowing Player1 and Player2 to mutually participate in the game by following the steps below: 
1. Player1 gets to start the game by placing the X anywhere on the board. 
2. After his turn is complete, Player2 then places an O on any of the remianing squares in the 3 x 3 grid. 
3. This process continues to repeat until either all the grids are full and no-one has won the game or until somone has won the game. 

## Winning the game
The final step is solving the problem of Tic-Tac-Toe is for any one of Player1 or Player2 to win the game. This can be done through either of the scenarios described below : 

1. Player1 or Player2 are able to fill one entire row or column with their respective X or O piece.
2. Player1 or Player2 are able to fill the center cell as well as the linearly opposite corners of the 3 x 3 grid adjacent to the center cell with their respectove X or O piece.

### Keeping Score
In order to determine the final winner of a Tic-Tac-Toe game, the Players may keep a tally of the number of indivdual games they win and compare their wins at the end of the pre-determined Tic-Tac-Toe matches.
