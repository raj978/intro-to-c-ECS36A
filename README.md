# intro-to-c-ECS36A
This is a compilation of all the assignments to be completed as part of ECS 36A at UC Davis in the Fall of 2023 taught by Professor Matthew Butner.

Most of the code in this language was taught using an online notebook called ZyBooks, which was an online interactive notebook that allowed students to understand and compile C program in an easy to use way. Whereas, majority of the code in this repository was assigned on prairie-learn. It is an online homework grading platform for coding problems. 

I have posted the assignments in the same order as they were assigned. Generally, each of these sets were assigned a week of time to complete.
