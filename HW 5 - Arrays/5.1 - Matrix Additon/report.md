# Algorithm (steps to solve the problem)

## Understanding the problem
This is a program that is trying to add 2 matrices A and B, by first providing the number of rows and columns of Matrix A and B, which is followed by the addition of each of the values adding the respective rows and columns

## Problem Abstraction 
This problem, must be solved using at least 3 functions which could be : 
1. Function to input matrix A and B 
2. Function to add the 2 matrices
3. Function to output the new matrix

#### Function to input Matrix A and B
This function will be called from the main function and will basically go through the input and save the entire matrix into a integer array. Since its a function it wil be called for the inoput of both matrices A and B.

#### Function to add matrix A and B
This function will essentially take the 2 matrices as input. Add them and return a third integer array with its values made up from the additon of A and B.

#### Function to output the new matrix
This matrix, will again go through the elements of the final integer array obtained from the previous function and output them in a given order.

## Conclusion
There hasn't be a real mention of the main function since its really not doing a lot other than calling the other functions.
